### **How it works**
1. Captures the bid requests generated by fake-ad exchange.
2. Stores the bid requests in embedded Redis cache in queue.
3. Generates random Ad Campaigns to match with the bid request.
4. Matches ad campaigns to bid request pulled from Redis cache.
5. Selects winning bid and sends to UI.
6. Statistical data is also generated and stored in embedded H2 Database. It shows the maximum, minimum, and average price of all campaigns per bid, response rate (total number of campaigns per bid), as well as winning IAB categories.

The data can be checked in the UI below:

- Bid capture api : http://localhost:5758/big/request [POST]
- Response api http://localhost:5758/bid/response [SSE Emitter]
- Api to access ui http://localhost:5758/ui/live

### **Bid matching criteria logic explanation**
In the data generated by the fake-ad exchange certain fields were observed to show randomness and the other fields were constant.
Random fields were: "banner", "placementId", "device", "lat" and "lon" fields in  "geo", "ip", "bcat".
Since the "at" value generated by fake-ad exchange is always zero, I have created a simple logic to select based on the highest bidding amount generated.
My solution generates random Ad campaigns per request between 1 to 50 based on the above mentioned random fields and the matching is done based on the following steps:
1. All campaigns which match the blocked IAB categories are excluded
2. Matching banner dimentions and placement id are selected
3. Device types are matched
4. Maximum price bid from remaining is selected

### Tools and Technologies in Use
- Spring Boot
- Embedded H2 Database
- Embedded Redis Cache
Note: Due to compatibility issue with embedded Redis Cache the Docker image was not created.
